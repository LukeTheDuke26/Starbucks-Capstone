## Project Overview

### Domain
This project falls under the domain of customer segmentation and recommendation systems in the context of retail and marketing. Starbucks, one of the world’s most popular coffee shop chains, regularly sends offers to its customers as part of its marketing strategy. The effectiveness of these offers can vary significantly among different customer demographics. Understanding which offers are most likely to be completed by different types of customers is a critical task for optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement.

### Origin of the Project
This project is designed as a capstone challenge for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program. The primary goal of the project is to build a demographic-based offer recommendation system for Starbucks. This system aims to predict which offers are likely to be completed by different demographic groups, based on historical data provided by Starbucks. The aim is to leverage machine learning techniques to make these predictions, thereby enabling more personalized and effective marketing strategies.

### Datasets
The data for this project is provided by Starbucks and consists of three main files:

1. **`portfolio.json`**: This file contains metadata about each offer that Starbucks sends out. It includes attributes such as the offer’s type, difficulty level, reward, and duration.
2. **`profile.json`**: This dataset contains demographic data for each customer, including age, gender, income, and the date they became a Starbucks rewards member.
3. **`transcript.json`**: This file contains records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed. It provides a detailed log of customer behavior in response to the offers they received.

### In-Depth Analysis Document
An initial analysis of the Starbucks data has been performed and is summarized in the document titled "1. An In-Depth Analysis of Starbucks Offers- A First Approach to the Data.pdf". This analysis explores the characteristics of the customer base, the nature of the offers sent out, and preliminary insights into how different demographic groups respond to different types of offers. It serves as the foundational research that informed the design and approach of this project.


## Installation

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Descriptions

- `data_preparation.py`: Contains functions for loading, cleaning, and merging the datasets, and segmenting users based on age.
- `ml_modeling.py`: Contains functions and procedures to train a logistic regression machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will complete an offer based on their demographics and offer details.
- `recommendation_engine.py`: This file defines the Recommendation Engine, which uses the trained machine learning model to suggest the most appropriate offer type for a specific user based on their demographic information. It contains methods for initializing the recommendation engine, training it with user data, and generating personalized offer recommendations.
- `main.py`: The main entry point to the project. It orchestrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and offer recommendation for a specific user based on their demographic information.


### Recommendation Engine (`recommendation_engine.py`)

The `RecommendationEngine` class is designed to help Starbucks or any other user make personalized offer recommendations. Here is how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Instantiate the `RecommendationEngine` with the trained machine learning model and a dataset containing user demographic information and offer details.

2. **Training the Recommendation Engine**: 
   - The engine uses the provided trained machine learning model to make predictions. 

3. **Generate Personalized Offer Recommendations**: 
   - Input a user's demographic information (age, income, gender) into the recommendation engine. The engine will use the trained model to predict the likelihood of this user completing various types of offers.
   - The engine will recommend the offer type that the user is most likely to complete.

4. **Example Use Case for Starbucks**:
   - Starbucks can use this engine to automatically send the most relevant offers to each user, likely increasing the conversion rate and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Methodology

- Data Loading and Exploration
- Data Preprocessing
- Machine Learning Modeling
- Offer Recommendation

## Results and Model Performance

The Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance:

- Training Accuracy: Approximately 86.34%
- Test Accuracy: Approximately 86.18%


Certainly! Below is a "How To Use" section that you can copy and paste into your README.md file. It provides a step-by-step guide for someone using the `ml_modeling.py` and `recommendation_engine.py` files in your project:

## How To Use This Project

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the machine learning model and generate personalized offer recommendations for Starbucks Customers using this project.

### Step 1: Data Preparation
Before you begin, you need to prepare the data.

- **Action**: Run the `data_preparation.py` script to generate the cleaned and merged dataset.

### Step 2: Train the Machine Learning Model
Once the data is prepared, the next step is to train a machine learning model, which in this case is a logistic regression model.

- **Action**: Run the `ml_modeling.py` script to train and evaluate the logistic regression model. Save the trained model for use in the recommendation engine.

### Step 3: Use the Recommendation Engine
With a trained machine learning model in hand, you can now use that model to make personalized offer recommendations for individual Starbucks customers.

- **Action**:
  1. Load the trained machine learning model from Step 2.
  2. Instantiate the `RecommendationEngine` class from `recommendation_engine.py` with the loaded model.
  3. Call a method (defined in `RecommendationEngine`) to input a customer's demographic information and get back a recommended offer for that customer.

### Step 4: Deploy and Use in a Real-world Scenario
At this stage, you can integrate this system into Starbucks' existing customer engagement pipelines.

- **Action**: Integrate this system into Starbucks' existing customer engagement pipelines, such as setting it up to run automatically at regular intervals or tying it into Starbucks' app or email system.

### Step 5: Monitor and Iterate
After deploying, you will want to monitor how well the system is performing in the real world and iterate on it.

- **Action**: Regularly review the performance of the recommendations, gather new data, and iterate on the model and recommendation engine as needed.

**Note**: The actual implementation might vary, but this guide provides a general sense of how the components fit together and how a user might interact with them.

### Addressing Data Imbalance

The model showed a bias towards predicting "offer not completed". This is indicative of an imbalance in the dataset, where one class of the target variable is significantly more prevalent. 

**Potential Solutions to Address Data Imbalance:**

- **Resampling**: This involves either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class. 
- **Using Different Metrics**: Accuracy might not be the best metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are alternative metrics.
- **Using Different Algorithms**: Some algorithms, like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, might handle imbalanced data better.

## Challenges and Future Work

- Data Imbalance
- Model Choice
- Feature Engineering
- Hyperparameter Tuning
